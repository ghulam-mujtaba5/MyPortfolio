Got it, Mujtaba — you want a massive, modern, premium-level list of 100 advanced features, sub-features, and UI/UX improvements for a self-use admin portal for managing projects and articles on ghulammujtaba.com.
I’ll design this like you’re building something that feels as smooth as Notion, as clean as Vercel’s dashboard, and as smart as an AI-powered CMS — but still personal and custom for you.

If you build even 60% of these, your admin portal will feel like a premium SaaS dashboard — even though it’s just for your own projects & articles.
I can next prepare a full-page flowchart + UI component structure showing how every section, sub-section, and feature connects, so you can implement without missing any detail.
Do you want me to create that visual feature map next? It will make your development plan much clearer.
